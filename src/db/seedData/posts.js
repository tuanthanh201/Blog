    title: 'How to Get the Value of a Checked Checkbox with JavaScript?',
    body: 'Sometimes, we may want to get the value of a checked checkbox within our web app.\n\nIn this article, we’ll look at how to get the value of a checked checkbox with JavaScript.\n\n### Get All Checked Checkboxes\n\nWe can use plain JavaScript to get all the checked checkboxes.\n\nFor instance, if we have the following checkboxes:\n\n```\n<input type="checkbox" value="1" name="mailId[]" checked>1\n<input type="checkbox" value="2" name="mailId[]" checked>2\n<input type="checkbox" value="3" name="mailId[]">3\n```\n\nThen we can select all the checkboxes that are checked and get their values with:\n\n```\nconst checked = document.querySelectorAll(\'input[type="checkbox"]:checked\');\nconsole.log([...checked].map(c => c.value))\n```\n\nWe add the ```:checked``` pseudoselector to select all the checked checkboxes.\n\nThe first 2 checkboxes have the ```checked``` attribute, so we should get the value of the first 2 with it.\n\nThen we log the ```value``` property.\n\nWe spread the ```checked``` NodeList into an array.\n\nThen we call ```map``` with a callback to return the ```value``` property of each checkbox that is checked.\n\nTherefore, the console log should log ```[“1”, “2”]```.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe can get the value of all the checked checkboxes with plain JavaScript.\n',

    title: 'How to read code — better',
    body: 'I believe that for a programmer, the amount of time spent *Reading code* versus the amount of time spent *Writing code* follows the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)\n\nA research done on [Measuring Program Comprehension](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318811113_Measuring_Program_Comprehension_A_Large-Scale_Field_Study_with_Professionals) conveys that, a programmer spends anywhere between 50–60% of time on code comprehension and 20–30% of time in code navigation.\n\n![1 yMghdzTifXZyyEZPMyfLSQ.png](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/4f3d94d9-30a7-4b76-b73a-1a8ba4655f76)\n\nIrrespective of the numbers, I think anyone who has spent more than a year working as a software developer would agree that we definitely spend most of our time reading the code than writing it. But the significance of reading code is often neglected. And I think we should consciously spend some time and effort in improving this skill.\n\nBelow are some suggestions on becoming better at reading code:\n\n### 1. Read Good Code\n\nI can hear the slow-claps. But honestly, I think reading **good** code is the first step towards getting better at reading any code.\n\nGood code is something that feels like poetry. When you read such code, you develop interest in reading code, and furthermore, it encourages you to write better code.\n\nYou can find the inspiration from this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/4d5y6u) for some good open source repositories to browse through. ([Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) is one of my favorites)\n\n### 2. Stick to an Editor and become a Pro at it\n\nI believe that getting accustomed to a feature rich text editor (like VS Code or Sublime Text) is *arguably* better than getting stuck to a language specific IDE such as (PyCharm or PHPStorm — IntelliJ is an exception though!).\n\n![0 OAJ43dQhpV-w_y3W.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/34854dc0-c4b1-4979-9f6a-17b37b8fb6e7)\n\nAs we saw at the [beginning of the article](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yMghdzTifXZyyEZPMyfLSQ.png), around 20–30% of the time is spent in navigating the code, so the ability to navigate faster with a text editor that you are well versed with (and mastered the shortcuts), will speed up your ability to hop around the code base quickly and grasp the functionality.\n\nI agree that some IDEs offer better navigation with respect to specific language you’re working with, but you can achieve almost the same functionality with a hackable text editor — with a one-time investment of time and effort in setting up things (shortcuts, extensions and so on).\n\nBeing [language agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-agnostic) is a desired skill for a developer these days and in my opinion, being attached to an IDE is not recommended for the long run.\n\n### 3. Refactor other people’s code\n\nWhen you come across a piece of code that you don’t understand, try refactoring it. Only then you would understand the importance of that piece of code that seems like it doesn’t belong there in a first glance.\n\nI have come a full circle in this respect where I removed an old piece of code assuming that it has no business being there, only to introduce a bug, which was found out couple of days later, forcing me to diligently put back the code I removed — but this time understanding the better of it.\n\n### 4. git blame\n\n![0 _JJmDxJCistA8WRQ.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/1a954954-122c-4b4b-bfb7-e3b8ac267634)\n\n*git blame* is my most favorite feature of git. Apart from using it to look up the name of the developer, who wrote the cryptic verses amidst of poetry to curse the poor guy (only to find out that it’s you who wrote it 6 months back) *git blame* can be used effectively to find out why that piece of code/functionality has been added.\n\nAssuming the repository contributors follow some guidelines on naming commits, writing good PR descriptions and linking to right issues, you can explore the whole story behind a single line of code.\n\n### 5. Read Test Cases\n\nIf you are lucky enough to be working on a project or a code base that has good test coverage, it is highly recommended to go through the Test Suite to understand the code.\n\nGood test cases enforces the code to just be what it is supposed to be. Hence test cases serve as a good tool in understanding the purpose of code.\n\nAs [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) states,\n> *Tests are a good documentation of what a piece of code is supposed to do.*\n\n### 6. Connecting the dots\n\nAnd finally, connecting the individual pieces that you understand is a good approach for improving the understanding of the code base. When I begin to understand a piece of code or functionality, I try to back track my way towards the root.\n\nStarting from a single point and branching out from there is a good strategy in improving the code comprehension. After a few walks back and forth this path, you will start getting familiar with the *What’s* and the *Why’s* of the code.\n\n### Epilogue\n\nAll in all, reading code >> writing code (I guess I repeated this enough times in this article).\n\nBut what about writing good code, which makes the experience of reading better? Well that deserves another article!',

    title: 'Is Aging a Disease or a Natural Process?',
    body: 'Philosophers have argued for millennia whether aging is a natural process or a disease to be cured. The debate — gaining fresh vigor in recent years with advances in understanding disease causes even while science still can’t explain exactly why or how we age — is full of genuine scientific disagreement, laced with idealistic dreams of immortality, and loaded with ethical concerns.\n\nBiological aging is not just a source, but the source of many debilitating and deadly diseases, [argues](https://heales.org/) the Healthy Life Extension Society, led by Sven Bulterijs, a postgraduate researcher who studies the biology of aging at the University of Ghent in Belgium. “The only way to prevent these illnesses linked to aging is to attack the principal cause — aging itself,” the group contends. “It is time to start working toward solutions to this universal human tragedy.”\n\nThose bold assertions, particularly viewing aging as a tragedy, are not shared by the majority of aging experts.\n\n“Aging is a natural part of life for those who are lucky enough to live a long time,” says Sharona Hoffman, JD, a professor of law and bioethics at Case Western Reserve University and author of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Aging-Plan-Thought-Improve-Tomorrow/dp/1839982365/), *Aging With a Plan: How a Little Thought Today Can Vastly Improve Your Tomorrow*. “Aging should not be considered a disease in and of itself.”\n\nThe National Institute on Aging concurs, in what serves as an [official scientific stance](https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/aging-strategic-directions-research/goal-biology-impact) on the issue, a nuanced view that emphasizes the complex, two-way relationship between aging and illness: “Aging is not, in and of itself, a disease. However, aging is the major risk factor for developing many major chronic diseases. Furthermore, many diseases appear to accelerate the aging process — which is manifested as declines in functionality and reduced quality of life.”\n\n### What is disease, anyway?\n\nAmong the many loose ends driving this debate is the startling fact that there is no universal, formal medical description for the word “disease.”\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) [defines](https://www.who.int/about/governance/constitution#:~:text=Health%20is%20a%20state%20of,belief%2C%20economic%20or%20social%20condition). “health” as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Yet disease is sometimes [defined](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/what-exactly-is-a-disease), if at all, only as being the opposite of health. Or it’s defined rather succinctly yet imprecisely as “illness or sickness characterized by specific signs and symptoms.”\n\nScientists sometimes refer to disease simply as an unwanted or [harmful deviation](https://www.britannica.com/science/disease) from the norm.\n\nMeanwhile, the list of maladies that are considered diseases is [fluid](https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/what-exactly-is-a-disease), illustrating ongoing challenges to conventional medical wisdom. Osteoporosis didn’t used to be on the list, but now it is. Homosexuality was on the list, and now it’s not. Whether obesity should be considered a disease is in the midst of [its own hot debate](https://www.healthline.com/health/is-obesity-a-disease#disagreement).\n\n### The argument for defining aging as a disease\n\nThe [case](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471741/) for characterizing biological aging as a disease argues, in part, that the physical decline that typically comes with chronological aging is harmful and unwanted, just like a disease, and there are [specific signs and symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23746838/) attributable to aging, Bulterijs and colleagues wrote in a 2015 article in the journal Cell.\n\nThis line of thinking has spurred some change.\n\nIn 2018, the WHO added to its disease classification system the notion of [“aging-related diseases"](https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f459275392), defined as those “caused by biological processes which persistently lead to the loss of organism’s adaptation and progress in older ages.” Examples include cataracts, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia (muscle loss), and dementia. Age is also now a big factor in broader health states or conditions that aren’t formally termed diseases, including urinary incontinence, frailty, and falls, the agency [notes](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health). But the WHO stopped short of calling aging a disease on its own.\n\nBy classifying aging as a disease, the fatalistic notion of it being “natural” would, proponents say, be replaced by greater efforts by you and I to adopt healthy habits and take medications that slow the aging process. Plus there’d be stronger efforts to study and treat aging, with support from federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health, which hands out research grants, and the Food and Drug Administration, which decides what medicines can be prescribed for what conditions. Think of how money and effort pour into researching cancer and other chronic diseases, prescribing treatments to battle against them, and engaging the entire health care and health insurance industries in the effort.\n\n“Work to develop medicines that could potentially prevent and treat most major diseases is going far slower than it should be because we don’t recognize aging as a medical problem,” [argues](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/08/19/133357/what-if-aging-werent-inevitable-but-a-curable-disease/) David Sinclair, PhD, a [controversial anti-aging proponent](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2019/10/29/david-sinclair/) and geneticist at Harvard Medical School and, it should be noted, a ​​co-founder of multiple biotechnology companies.\n\n“If aging were a treatable condition, then the money would flow into research, innovation, and drug development,” Sinclair says. “Right now, what pharmaceutical or biotech company could go after aging as a condition if it doesn’t exist?”\n\n### Downsides to calling aging a disease\n\nPhilosophically, calling aging a disease implies it can be cured, just as some people are cured of cancer. That portends a future in which people never die. A cynic might say that such hubris insinuates that life as we know it is not as it was meant to be, that the most universal truth in life — its end — is just a cosmic glitch or a divine error, depending on your point of view, and one that needs fixing.\n\nLogically, getting old is normal, not a deviation from the norm, the majority of experts and institutions agree. Even claims that the typical lifespan can be extended to, say, 150 years or more, are viewed as [“very, very unlikely”](https://elemental.medium.com/how-long-can-humans-really-live-1d9a7aef950a) based on a recent statistical analysis led by Michael Pearce, a doctoral student in statistics at the University of Washington.\n\nImmortality? Almost surely not in your lifetime.\n\n“If aging is a disease, then all 7.7 billion people on Earth have it, and everyone over the age of 65 has an advanced case,” the writer Joelle Renstrom [notes](https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/aging-disease-classification.html) in *Slate*.\n\nPractically speaking, there’s already [enough stigma](https://elemental.medium.com/anti-aging-advice-is-harmful-bs-9bb824ac0cad) and job discrimination associated with aging, says Hoffman, the Case Western bioethicist, even though “many people remain highly competent and contribute a great deal to society when they are in their eighties and beyond.”\n\nIndeed, some [“superagers”](https://elemental.medium.com/the-mysterious-remarkable-memories-of-superagers-bb4475592eb7) have 80-year-old brains that remain virtually indistinguishable from those of twentysomethings. And despite the common perception that time makes us inevitably frail and feeble, it’s [well established](https://elemental.medium.com/living-proof-that-its-never-too-late-to-start-exercising-ce88c17cca7a) that engaging in physical activity helps ward off chronic pain and other diseases and promotes mobility and overall physical and mental well-being later in life. Your mileage may vary, of course.\n\nLabeling aging a disease could have the opposite effect that proponents hope for. It could normalize physical or mental decline and foster complacency among aging patients and health care professionals by ignoring or downplaying other important lifestyle choices that can accelerate the aging process, including lack of physical activity but also poor diet, sleep problems, and even retirement, loss of a loved one, and lack of social interaction.\n\nAn inaccurate, unhealthy, self-fulfilling mindset could sink in: *I’m old, so I’m sick, just as expected. After all, aging is a disease!*\n\n“While some diseases are more likely to develop in older age, it would be very problematic to adopt the attitude that natural aging is itself a disease,” Hoffman tells me. “This would reinforce stigmatization and is not accurate.”\n\n### Enduring mysteries of aging\n\nOne reason this debate still exists: Scientists have yet to pin down exactly why and how our bodies age toward dysfunction, vexing questions given that natural selection generally favors survival and reproductive success. The answers, according to various theories, likely involve at least [three interacting processes](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ph/aging/aging_print.html) related to senescence, when cells stop dividing to regenerate and rejuvenate skin, muscles, the brain, and other organs and body parts:\n\n* Cell divisions can cause genetic mutations that build up, degrading cell function.\n* Each cell division shortens a chromosome’s protective telomeres, until the cell can no longer divide.\n* In their routine work of creating energy, cells also generate waste that can lead to a buildup of damaging molecules.\n\n“These changes are neither linear nor consistent, and they are only loosely associated with a person’s age in years,” the World Health Organization [explains](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health).\n\nWhile aging is inevitable (at least for now) the pace at which any of us ages, or at which certain organs age, is not predetermined nor highly predictable. Several biological, environmental, and social factors, some in our control and some not so much, determine whether and how soon our chronological advancement, on its own or in cahoots with other factors, leads to our demise.\n\n“Aging might predispose to some chronic medical or mental health conditions with other factors playing a much greater role in the disease causation than age alone,” psychiatrist Debanjan Banerjee, MD, and colleagues [wrote](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhl/article/PIIS2666-7568(21)00201-4/fulltext) last year in The Lancet journal.\n\nThis leads some to emphasize [two aspects to aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471741/): primary, intrinsic aging versus secondary or accelerating aging — that which goes beyond the norm. For example, your skin will age normally, and there’s only so much you can do about it. Spend too much time in the sun, and your skin will age faster, wrinkle sooner, and possibly develop deadly cancer.\n\nThis much is clear: People and the cells inside them age at different rates, based on everything from their initial genetic makeup to their physical, social, and family environments to health habits and lifestyle choices, and even whether they [fear or embrace](https://elemental.medium.com/anti-aging-secret-revealed-embrace-getting-older-44e6442ea2b3) getting older.\n\n### Pushing for change in aging research\n\nRegardless if aging is ever defined as a disease on its own or not, there are highly practical reasons to study the relationship between biological aging and disease.\n\nMing Guo, MD, a neurologist and professor of neurology, molecular, and medical pharmacology at UCLA, treats patients with degenerative brain disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. In 2006, with colleagues, she [discovered how two genes](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ming-guo-aging-research) do quality control in mitochondria, the energy factories inside cells. The findings led to insights into premature aging and its links to diseases of the brain and body, including cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.\n\n“If we could pause, delay, or even reverse aging, we would make a significant impact against numerous diseases,” Guo says. “I want to create a higher quality of life over a healthy life span, rather than just prolonging life.”\n\nGuo sees aging as the natural course of development in humans, as in other animals. “Aging as a whole concept is not a disease,” she says in an email.\n\nBut there’s much room for improvement on the research front. With rare exception, there are no reliable ways to measure premature or accelerated biological aging of the whole body or individual tissues, she explains. By changing policies, without labeling aging as a disease, more funding could flow into research that would allow the identification and treatment of premature aging in certain tissues.\n\nOne research project on the drawing board, called [Targeting Aging with Metformin](https://www.afar.org/tame-trial) (TAME), seeks to force such change, Guo points out. It’s aiming for funding from the NIH and approval from the FDA to consider aging not as a disease, but as an “indication” that could be treated. Clinical trials would test the effectiveness on aging of metformin, a drug that was long ago approved by the FDA to treat diabetes.\n\n“If aging is made an indication, the TAME Trial will mark a paradigm shift: from treating each age-related medical condition separately, to treating these conditions together, by targeting aging per se,” the project’s website states.\n\n### On the bright side\n\nThe debate over whether aging is a disease often ignores positive effects of putting some time under one’s belt.\n\n“Aging confers attributes such as a greater sense of satisfaction, greater resilience, subjective well-being, and wisdom,” Banerjee and colleagues wrote in *The Lancet*. And, they noted, some diseases tend to lessen with age. “It is evident that various psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder are much less prevalent in old age than in young age.”\n\nYears upon years of living add up to one undeniable fact: We’re all growing chronologically older, and on average, [older people are much happier](https://elemental.medium.com/why-older-people-are-so-much-happier-888e86eaa4f9) than middle-aged individuals.\n\nIf that’s a disease, it’s one most of us might reasonably look forward to.',

    title: 'Octopus Facts',
    body: "Octopuses are ocean creatures that are most famous for having eight arms and bulbous heads. Some other fun facts: They have three hearts and blue blood; they squirt ink to deter predators; and being boneless, they can squeeze into (or out of) tight spaces. They are quite intelligent and have been observed using tools.\n\nAnd sadly, for them, sex is a death sentence.\n\n### Description\n\nThe order Octopoda includes 289 species, according to the [World Animal Foundation](http://www.worldanimalfoundation.net/f/octopus.pdf). The word also refers specifically to animals in the genus *Octopus*. The word octopus comes from the Greek, *októpus*, which means \"eight foot,\" according to a [Smithsonian magazine article](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-curious-facts-about-octopuses-7625828/) that summarized facts in Katherine Harmon Courage's book, \"[Octopus! The Most Mysterious Creature in the Sea](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=74387&GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2F1591845270%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dlivescience-us-1375646416764278800-20).\" \n\nSome people call their appendages tentacles, but that is incorrect; they are arms. Most octopus species have suction cups on the bottom of each arm. The arms seem to have a mind of their own. In fact, two-thirds of an octopus' neurons are in its arms rather than its head, according to the article. That means that an octopus can focus on exploring a cave for food with one arm while another arm tries to crack open a shellfish. \n\nSome octopuses even have warts. Two deep-sea octopuses in the Graneledone genus — *G. pacifica and G. verrucosa* — have skin bumps dotting their pink-hued mantles. These warty protrusions, it turns out, [can be used to distinguish the two species](https://www.livescience.com/59401-octopus-species-defined-by-warts.html), which have been incredibly difficult to tell apart. Scientists reporting June 7, 2017 in the [journal Marine Biology Research](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17451000.2017.1303166) catalogued the distribution of warts on both species, pinpointing two variables that were consistent across the individuals within a given species: distance between the warts and the tip of the mantle and the extent to which the skin bumps spread down the creature's arms.   \n\nOctopuses have an [excellent sense of touch](http://www.worldanimalfoundation.net/f/octopus.pdf), according to the World Animal Foundation. Their suckers have receptors that enable an octopus to taste what it is touching. \n\nMost octopuses — those in the suborder Incirrata (or Incirrina) — have no internal skeletons or protective shells. Their bodies are soft, enabling them to squeeze into small cracks and crevices, according to [National Geographic](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&xcust=livescience_us_3471844650059898400&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fanimals.nationalgeographic.com%2Fanimals%2Finvertebrates%2Fcommon-octopus%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F55478-octopus-facts.html). In April 2016, an octopus at the National Aquarium of New Zealand [squeezed out of its tank](https://www.livescience.com/54427-how-octopus-escapes-new-zealand-aquarium.html) and made an eight-armed dash for a drainpipe that — luckily for him — led directly to the sea.\n\nA bulbous sack-like body, or mantle, is perched on top of an octopus' head. The only hard part of their bodies is a sharp, parrot-like beak that is on the underside, where the arms converge. Octopuses have powerful jaws and venomous saliva, according to National Geographic.\n\nOctopuses weren't always squishy creatures. The ancestors of octopuses and squid sported hard shells. A study published online March 1, 2017 in the journal [Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.2818) revealed these marine animals lost their hard \"mobile homes\" in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. This [shell loss likely helped the ancient relatives](https://www.livescience.com/58063-why-the-octopus-lost-its-shell.html) of today's octopus, squid and cuttlefish become more agile to evade predators and nab prey, the researchers said. \n\n### Three hearts\n\nAn octopus has three hearts. One pumps blood through its organs; the two others pump blood through its gills, according to the World Animal Foundation. Octopus blood is blue because it has a copper-based protein called hemocyanin. \n\nWhen an octopus is swimming, the organ that delivers blood to the organs stops beating. This exhausts the octopus, which is likely the reason they prefer to crawl than swim, according to the Smithsonian article.\n\n### Size\n\nOctopuses come in many different sizes. The common octopus (*Octopus vulgaris*) is 12 to 36 inches (30.5 to 91.4 centimeters) long and weighs 6.6 to 22 lbs. (3 to 10 kilograms). \n\nThe giant Pacific octopus (*Enteroctopus dofleini*) is the largest octopus. They typically grow to 16 feet (5 meters) long and weight around 110 lbs. (50 kg), but one was recorded to weigh more than 600 lbs. (272 kg) and measure 30 feet (9.1 m) across, according to [National Geographic](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&xcust=livescience_us_2121048131722016000&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fanimals.nationalgeographic.com%2Fanimals%2Finvertebrates%2Fgiant-pacific-octopus&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F55478-octopus-facts.html). \n\nThe smallest octopus is the *Octopus wolfi*. It is smaller than an inch (2.5 cm) long and weighs less than a gram.\n\n![2j6RuSW6nnx9vRg9LhbXqb-970-80.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/b8e4fc47-45e4-464b-a911-d07486b84d47)\n\n### Habitat\n\nOctopuses live in oceans all over the world. Most are pelagic, meaning they live near the water's surface in shells, reefs and crevices. Some species live on the floor of the ocean, making their homes out of caves. \n\n### Habits \n\nOctopuses tend to be solitary, though they do interact with other octopuses at times. Some species of octopuses hunt at night, while others only hunt at dusk and dawn. \n\nWhen scared, octopuses will shoot a dark liquid, sometimes called ink, at the thing that scared them. This will temporarily blind and confuse a potential attacker, giving the octopus time to swim away. The ink can also dull the attacker’s smelling and tasting abilities, according to the Smithsonian article.  \n\nOctopuses can also change color to hide and match their surroundings. They can turn blue, gray, pink, brown or green. The mimic octopus can also flex its body to resemble more dangerous animals, such as eels and lionfish, according to the World Animal Foundation.\n\nIf an octopus does get caught — no problem. They can lose arms and regrow them, according to National Geographic. \n\nOctopuses are fast swimmers but they prefer to slowly crawl along the sea bottom. To swim, octopuses suck water into their bodies and shoot it out a tube called a siphon, according to the World Animal Foundation. This lets the octopus blast off, away from attackers. \n\n### Diet\n\nOctopuses are carnivores, which means they eat meat. Meals can include clams, shrimp, lobsters, fish, sharks and even birds. Octopuses typically drop down on their prey, envelop it with their arms and pull the animal into their mouth.\n\n![7DhiV9a9j9xqoMVUGtw2JM-970-80.jpeg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/90f50c3d-f651-4384-a229-a64a3c50ee5f)\n\n### Offspring\n\nOctopuses have short life spans. Some species only live for around six months. Other species, like the North Pacific giant octopus can live as long as five years. Typically, the larger the octopus, the longer it lives, according to the World Animal Foundation.\n\nNo matter what, when octopuses mate, they die soon after. During reproduction, a male delivers sperm by inserting a specialized arm (usually the third right arm) into the female's mantle cavity, according to the World Animal Foundation. Sometimes he literally hands her the sperm, however, according to the Smithsonian article. \n\nFemales usually lay 200,000 to 400,000 eggs, though it varies depending on species. She obsessively guards the eggs until they hatch. She even stops eating. After the eggs hatch, her body turns on her, according to the Smithsonian article. It goes through cellular suicide, which rips through her tissues and organs until she dies. Meanwhile, the male has swum away and dies in a few months.\n\nWhen they hatch, baby octopuses are called larvae. They drift in plankton clouds and eat other animal larvae until they mature. As part of the plankton cloud, they are also in danger of being eaten by plankton eaters, according to the World Animal Foundation.\n\n### Classification/Taxonomy\n\nThe order Octopoda has two suborders: the more familiar Incirrina (or Incirrata) and the lesser-known Cirrina (or Cirrata). Cirrata octopods have two fins and an internal shell (which makes it harder for them to squeeze into small spaces). \n\nHere is the classification of Incirrata octopuses in the Octopus genus, according to [Integrated Taxonomic Information System](http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=82326) (ITIS):\n\n* **Kingdom**: Animalia\n* **Subkingdom**: Bilateria\n* **Infrakingdom**: Protostomia \n* **Superphylum**: Lophozoa \n* **Phylum**: Mollusca \n* **Class**: Cephalopoda \n* **Subclass**: Coleoidea \n* **Subclass**: Nautiloidea \n* **Superorder**: Octobrachia\n* **Order**: Octopoda \n* **Suborder**: Incirrina \n* **Family**: Octopodidae \n* **Subfamily**: Octopodinae \n* **Genus**: *Octopus*\n\n### Conservation status\n\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, most octopus species are not endangered. Most are either listed as least concern or as data deficient, which means there isn’t enough data about the species to make a determination on their endangered status. \n\n[Cirroctopus hochbergi](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/163337/0), a species found off New Zealand, is endangered because its population size is low and its habitat has been damaged by trawling.\n\n### Other facts\n\nThe standard plural in English of octopus is octopuses, according to the [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/octopus). As a word that comes from Greek, it follows Greek rules for plurals. The word \"octopi,\" which follows Latin rules for plurals, is incorrect.\n\nNot all octopuses have long arms. The [Opisthoteuthis adorabilis’](https://www.livescience.com/51282-aptly-named-animals-gallery.html) arms are very short and have webbing in between each one. This gives the tiny octopus the look of an orange ghost.\n\nOctopuses are about as smart as house cats. \n\nThe oldest octopus fossil is from an animal that lived 296 million years ago — millions of years before the dinosaurs lived.\n\n#### Additional resources\n\n* [National Geographic Kids: Octopus](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&xcust=livescience_us_5554431244623232000&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fkids.nationalgeographic.com%2Fanimals%2Foctopus%2F%23octopus.jpg&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2F55478-octopus-facts.html)\n* [Monterey Bay Aquarium: Giant Pacific Octopus](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/animals-and-experiences/exhibits/giant-octopus)\n* [Smithsonian magazine: Ten Curious Facts About Octopuses](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/ten-curious-facts-about-octopuses-7625828)\n\n",

    title: '12 Shark Facts That May Surprise You',
    body: "### 1. Sharks do not have bones\n\nSharks use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. They are a special type of fish known as \"elasmobranchs\", which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissues—the clear gristly stuff that your ears and nose tip are made of. This category also includes rays, sawfish, and skates. Their cartilaginous skeletons are much lighter than true bone and their large livers are full of low-density oils, both helping them to be buoyant. \n\nEven though sharks don't have bones, they still can fossilize. As most sharks age, they deposit calcium salts in their skeletal cartilage to strengthen it. The dried jaws of a shark appear and feel heavy and solid; much like bone. These same minerals allow most shark skeletal systems to fossilize quite nicely. The teeth have enamel so they show up in the fossil record too.\n\n![md_S4QJPz8F7nKr.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/f85ef601-8bf6-4a9f-8fe9-463e7a4bcb11)\n\n### 2. Most sharks have good eyesight\n\nMost sharks can see well in dark lighted areas, have fantastic night vision, and can see colors. The back of sharks’ eyeballs have a reflective layer of tissue called a tapetum. This helps sharks see extremely well with little light.\n\n![A night shark's green eye](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration-miss/1280_gdJqZ1tXVaa0.jpg?1532343761)\n\n### 3. Sharks have special electroreceptor organs\n\nSharks have small black spots near the nose, eyes, and mouth. These spots are the ampullae of Lorenzini – special electroreceptor organs that allow the shark to sense electromagnetic fields and temperature shifts in the ocean.\n\n### 4. Shark skin feels similar to sandpaper.\n\nShark skin feels exactly like sandpaper because it is made up of tiny teeth-like structures called placoid scales, also known as dermal denticles. These scales point towards the tail and help reduce friction from surrounding water when the shark swims.\n\n![1280_g8GKkyB3XLI5.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/71dc687a-21d7-428f-ad24-d28f1dc4961e)\n\n### 5. Sharks can go into a trance. \n\nWhen you flip a shark upside down they go into a trance like state called tonic immobility. This is the reason why you often see sawfish flipped over when our scientists are working on them in the water.\n\n![Tagging smalltooth sawfish](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration-miss/1280_6mdK7l4u8Y51.jpg?1527643763)\n\n### 6. Sharks have been around a very long time.\n\nBased on fossil scales found in Australia and the United States, scientists hypothesize sharks first appeared in the ocean around 455 million years ago.\n\n![Grey reef shark](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration-miss/1280_QlgquroYwTu1.jpg?1532343525)\n\n### 7. Scientists age sharks by counting the rings on their vertebrae.\n\nVertebrae contain concentric pairs of opaque and translucent bands. Band pairs are counted like rings on a tree and then scientists assign an age to the shark based on the count. Thus, if the vertebrae has 10 band pairs, it is assumed to be 10 years old. Recent studies, however, have shown that this assumption is not always correct. Researchers must therefore study each species and size class to determine how often the band pairs are deposited because the deposition rate may change over time. Determining the actual rate that the bands are deposited is called \"validation\".\n\n### 8. Blue sharks are really blue.\n\nThe blue shark displays a brilliant blue color on the upper portion of its body and is normally snowy white beneath. The mako and porbeagle sharks also exhibit a blue coloration, but it is not nearly as brilliant as that of a blue shark. In life, most sharks are brown, olive, or grayish.\n\n![Blue shark](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration-miss/md_M11MxqKKtXc1.jpg?1532037280)\n\n### 9. Each whale shark’s spot pattern is unique as a fingerprint. \n\nWhale sharks are the biggest fish in the ocean. They can grow to 12.2 meters and weigh as much as 40 tons by some estimates! Basking sharks are the world's second largest fish, growing as long as 32 feet and weighing more than five tons.\n\n![Whale shark](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration-miss/1280_Mr12xztoqM03.jpg?1532344423)\n\n### 10. Some species of sharks have a spiracle that allows them to pull water into their respiratory system while at rest. Most sharks have to keep swimming to pump water over their gills.\n\nA shark's spiracle is located just behind the eyes which supplies oxygen directly to the shark's eyes and brain. Bottom dwelling sharks, like angel sharks and nurse sharks, use this extra respiratory organ to breathe while at rest on the seafloor. It is also used for respiration when the shark's mouth is used for eating.\n\n![Nurse shark](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration-miss/1280_02b9Ols8XIVD.jpg?1505931663)\n\n### 11. Not all sharks have the same teeth.\n\nMako sharks have very pointed teeth, while white sharks have triangular, serrated teeth. Each leave a unique, tell-tale mark on their prey. A sandbar shark will have around 35,000 teeth over the course of its lifetime! \n\n![Shortfin mako shark](https://media.fisheries.noaa.gov/dam-migration-miss/1280_ckoSMDUyBMD1.jpg?1532348590)\n\n### 12. Different shark species reproduce in different ways. \n\nSharks exhibit a great diversity in their reproductive modes. There are oviparous (egg-laying) species and viviparous (live-bearing) species. Oviparous species lay eggs that develop and hatch outside the mother's body with no parental care after the eggs are laid.",

    title: 'Do You Know About All The Things Pigeons Can Do?',
    body: 'How do you feel about pigeons? There are only three correct answers to this:\n\n1. I LOVE THEM. I AM OBSESSED WITH THEM. PIGEONS ARE TREMENDOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n2. Look, I’m not that in to pigeons, but I have respect for them.\n3. I don’t know how I feel about them, Sophie. That’s why I am here, reading this article.\n\nIf you are already in the first category, I imagine I’m not going to say anything you don’t already know. You probably have already read [this important piece](https://therumpus.net/2018/05/rumpus-exclusive-pigeon-manifesto/) by Michelle Téa, and maybe you’ve already read this [also-important comic](https://chicagoreader.com/city-life/behold-the-magnificent-pigeon/) that I made last year. Maybe you’re just here to have a [downloadable PDF](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/528c1030e4b0ce6fb73ab3c9/t/61f07002a5c73b7ba309bfcd/1643147267748/Untitled_Artwork+2.pdf) of this [“Things Pigeons Can Do”](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/528c1030e4b0ce6fb73ab3c9/t/61f07002a5c73b7ba309bfcd/1643147267748/Untitled_Artwork+2.pdf) poster. There it is. You can go now.\n\nIf you fall under categories two or three, or a fourth, unspoken anti-pigeon category, gather ‘round. Let me tell you a little bit about pigeons.\n\n### Pigeons can do a lot of human hang-out things.\n\nIt’s not like pigeons *have* to do human things, but they’ve historically been way nicer to us than we deserve. Humans have taught pigeons to play ping-pong, to race each other for sport, and become loyal friend that will return to your human self if you are willing and able to show them you care about them. This is really incredible, whereas humans are pigeons’ greatest predators. Frankly, we’re horrible to them, and they keep showing up for us.\n\n### Pigeons have fought in wars and saved lives.\n\nThe most famous war pigeon was [Cher Ami](https://medium.com/marvels-of-history/cheri-ami-the-war-hero-pigeon-69ad3eb35b3c), a male homing pigeon who delivered a critical message from an encircled battalion in World War I, *even though he was seriously injured*. (Yes, he did win a purple heart.) Because pigeons are so intelligent and loyal, many of them were trained as spies and messengers in early wars.\n\nThey continue to save human lives into the twenty-first century. Pigeons (who are fast, can fly, and have great eyesight) have been trained to to look for red or yellow life jackets in order to find people who have been lost at sea. And since they can perceive ultraviolet light surrounding a person in the water (!!!!!), there are experts who attest that pigeons are actually *better* than humans at making sea rescues.\n\n### There are 351 species of pigeons, and some of them are so beautiful your jaw is going to drop.\n\nMy personal favorite is the Victoria Crowned Pigeon, who is AS BIG AS A TURKEY and looks like it is going to the fanciest ball. I’ve seen one IRL at the Brookfield Zoo (and yes, I went to this zoo FOR THE SOLE REASON that I heard that they had this kind of pigeon), but it kind of broke my heart. This pigeon is too beautiful to be in a zoo. All pigeons are too beautiful to be in a zoo. All animals are too beautiful to be in a zoo. OK, moving on.\n\n### Pigeons used to carry our mail, and they still can.\n\nI’m sure you’ve heard of messenger pigeons (and if you haven’t, um, [Google it](https://www.google.com/search?q=carrier+pigeon&oq=carrier+pigeon&aqs=chrome.0.0i271j46i433i512j69i57j46i512j0i512l6.1553j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)), but you might not know the extent to which pigeons can reliably text for you. Pigeons have been used to send messages at least as far back as the 5th century AD, and can carry up to 10 percent of their body weight. Pigeons used to carry the results of the Olympics to people who were sports-obsessed in a pre-mass-communication past.\n\nThe last official pigeon post didn’t close until 2004 (it was in India!), and some people still use pigeons to send messages.\n\n### Pigeons are great at science, math, and analysis.\n\nIt would take a whole book ([and](https://books.google.com/books/about/Superdove.html?id=yVVACNT5mLkC&source=kp_book_description) [there](https://www.amazon.com/Pigeons-Fascinating-Worlds-Revered-Reviled/dp/0802143288) [are](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2020/11/03/pigeon-booklist) [several](https://books.google.com/books/about/It_s_a_Busload_of_Pigeon_Books.html?id=_MyRMQEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)) to properly dive into every STEM-y thing that pigeons can do, so here is a PARTIAL bullet-point list:\n\n* They can do basic math.\n* They can be taught complex actions and response sequences.\n* They can tell the difference between an impressionist and an abstract expressionist painting.\n* They can identify cancer cells better on average than cancer doctors.\n* They can tell the difference between other individual pigeons, and between individual humans.\n* They can recognize themselves in the mirror.\n* They can make models.\n* They can remember hundreds of individual images for years at a time.\n* I once personally watched a pigeon place a plastic water bottle over a plastic spike under an overpass that had been designed to deter pigeons, and then the pigeon sat on top of the water bottle and ultimately built a nest behind it and raised its babies behind it.\n\n### Pigeons have literally mystical homing abilities.\n\nReady for this? Pigeons can find their way back to their own nests from 1,300 miles away. That would be like if someone plopped you down in Havana and told you to find your way back to your house in Chicago.\n\nBut that’s not all: pigeons can do this even if they’ve been flown to Havana in an airplane, while concealed in a black box where sight, sound, and smell are completely absent. You might know that birds know what direction north is because of a magnet in their brains, but “north” is not going to get you to Chicago. You’d need sight markers or smell markers or something like that in order to get from Havana to Chicago. In human terms, this would be like if you had only ever hung out at YOUR HOUSE for your WHOLE LIFE, and then someone put you in an airplane where you were unable to see, hear, or smell anything, and flew you to Havana, and gave you a compass, and told you to find your way back to YOUR HOUSE.\n\nSo, yeah. Human scientists don’t know how pigeons can do this. They really don’t.\n\n### Pigeons aren’t actually dirty.\n\nMaybe you’ve heard that pigeons are dirty. That’s false. HUMANS are dirty, and pigeons are able to make use of some of our refuse to help them to survive. In fact, pigeons are incredibly clean and there is no research suggesting that they spread disease.\n\nFurthermore, pigeon poop (or, if you want to get sexy about it, “guano”) was once quite valuable, as it acts as terrific crop fertilizer. In fact, people used to employ guards to watch over dovecotes (that’s a pigeon house humans used to make in order to “keep” pigeons, and [you should read about them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovecote)) so people wouldn’t come and STEAL THE PIGEON POOP.\n\n### Pigeons model loving relationships that make human love look like a first draft.\n\nPigeons mate for life and live in complex communities of multiple families, like little pigeon communes that could teach us humans a thing or two about how to get along.\n\nIn terms of what I mean about “love,” here are the last few panels from [a comic I made for The Believer](https://believermag.com/avian-behavior/) that explains it.',

    title: 'How to make Beef Wellington',
    body: "So, you've decided to make Beef Wellington. Congratulations! You are about to make your dinner guests extremely happy. While the origins of this famous dish are unknown, we *do* know it's a holiday showstopper that it is **not** for the faint of heart. Below, we break down all the elements of a classic Beef Wellington from the inside out, so you can fearlessly make the best Wellington you can. We believe in you!\n\n### The Meat\n\nWe're starting with one of the most tender cuts of beef ever—the tenderloin! Beef tenderloin is super delicious, but without bones or much marbling, it's not the most flavorful cut of beef in the world. That is why we season liberally. (Read: about 1 teaspoon kosher salt per pound.) That is also why we sear the meat before anything else. Browning the meat on all sides, including the ends, does SO MUCH for the flavor of the Wellington as a whole.\n\n### The Mustard\n\nTo add another layer of complexity to the finished product, brush the seared tenderloin with mustard. Feel free to use your favorite type—we love a variety with some heat like dijon or spicy brown mustard. \n\n### The Mushrooms\n\nAKA the duxelle, this mixture of mushrooms, shallots, and thyme is SUPER savory. As if [beef tenderloin](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a55651/best-beef-tenderloin-recipe/) wasn't bringing enough umami, this mixture takes it to the next level. Word to the wise: don't try to speed up the cooking process on this one, you realllllly want to cook out as much of the moisture as possible. If you don't, the mushrooms will continue to lose moisture when you're baking the Wellington, which could lead to a soggy bottom.\n\n### The Prosciutto\n\nSpeaking of soggy bottoms (or more specifically, how to avoid them) meet your new bestie: prosciutto! Wrapping your tenderloin in prosciutto is a little extra insurance. It provides a barrier for moisture, and on top of that it adds even more delicious meaty flavor. By shingling a layer of prosciutto onto a layer of plastic wrap, you can easily spread your duxelle in an even layer and wrap your tenderloin evenly. It's a win/win!\n\n### The Pastry\n\nSome people like to make their own [puff pastry](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g37271980/puff-pastry-appetizers/) for their Beef Wellington. Those people are crazy. Well, maybe not crazy, but definitely overachievers. We've found that, not only is store bought puff pastry much more convenient, but it's also incredibly delicious. We're particularly fond of [this brand](http://www.dufourpastrykitchens.com/retail_puff.php), and honestly don't think we could make a better version if we tried. If you DO want to attempt making your own, check out [this step by step guide](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-puff-pastry-222312) from our friends over at the Kitchn.\n\nMade this? Let us know how it went in the comment section below!\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 1 (2 lb.) center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed\n* kosher salt\n* freshly ground black pepper\n* extra-virgin olive oil, for greasing\n* 2 tbsp. Dijon mustard\n* 1 1/2 lb. mixed mushrooms, roughly chopped\n* 1 shallot, roughly chopped\n* Leaves from 1 thyme sprig\n* 2 tbsp. unsalted butter\n* 12 thin slices prosciutto\n* all-purpose flour, for dusting\n* 14 oz. frozen puff pastry, thawed\n* 1 large egg, beaten\n* flaky salt, for sprinkling\n\n## Directions\n\n1. Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper. \n2. Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.\n3. Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.\n4. To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then let cool in fridge. \n5. Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it’s twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Shingle the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto. \n6. Season tenderloin, then place it at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).\n7. Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry. \n8. Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.\n9. Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt. \n10. Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before carving and serving.\n",

    title: 'My productive morning routine.',
    body: "## My productive morning routine.\n\nI was a total mess and studied whenever I felt like and did things in a very sloppy manner and as a result, I was having trouble focusing on my studies and productivity was at its worst until I came up with a routine that worked wonders for me. Well, my motto was whatever routine I follow I needed to get the majority of my things done early. My routine may not be resonating with you. Everyone is unique and everyone works according to what suits them.\n\nMy morning routine is from 4:30 AM to 10 AM.\n\nYeah, I am a morning person so let's begin.\n\n### 1. Wake up at 4:30 Am.\n\nMy day starts exactly at 4:30 AM when my alarm goes off. You might be thinking why I wake up so early. Well, the answer is I am an early bird 🐦. I have been reading biographies of successful people and some self-help books and they seem to tell the same thing that is to wake up early.\n\nI prefer walking up early also because I love the silence and calmness at that time. It's absolutely quiet and gives me an absolute aura to work and be productive before the hustle and bustle sets in.\n\n### 2. Make myself Ready(till 4:45 AM)\n\nAfter I wake up there is a whole set of activities I do to get freshen up and all this helps me have a calm mind which helps me study better.\n\nI) Freshen up: After gazing at the walls of my room for a minute with my half-opened eyes I go to the bathroom brush my teeth, wash my face and take deep breaths.\n\nPro tip: Washing your face with cold water helps you feel awakened.\n\nII) Drinking water: Then I finally reach out to my water bottle on my bedside. You should drink a glass of water after you wake up 😴⏰ it feels good and also keeps you hydrated because your body didn't get water for hours when you were sleeping. Moreover, it helps you freshen up and helps you get over your dizziness.\n\nIII) Making my bed 🛏. Well, this is a habit that I have recently started and it's worth it. I was to keep my bed as it is and didn't even care to make it until my brother told me how important it is to make your bed. It makes you feel independent and also doing this small work gives you a small positive vibe.\n\nIV) Meditation and Planning\n\nThe next thing that I do is meditation 🧘‍♀️. Meditation helps me calm my mind and also it's early morning so it's absolute calm and quiet. Meditation is relaxing the mind and helps you connect with yourself. In that 15 minutes of meditation, I sit quietly and just focus on my breaths and nothing!\n\nThen it's time for planning my day. I don't use any apps but maintain a diary and write down everything I have to do on that particular day. Meditating just before planning helps me to think and plan with a clear mind.\n\nAt the end of the day, I see the list again and see how much I have been able to be productive and get the most out of the day.\n\nIt's almost 5 AM by now.\n\n### 3. Exercise time till 6 AM.\n\nNow that I am done with meditation and planning my day. I then get my running shoes and track pants and move on for having a good morning walk. The best part about morning walks is that you realize that half of the city is still sleeping and the roads are empty. Fewer vehicles, fewer commotions less pollution and everything feels so calm and quiet.\n\nI feel good after having a walk and health is what I have prioritized for a long time.\n\n### 4. Getting my table done.\n\nAfter returning from the walk and getting freshened up it's time to clear my table. The mess I have created last day. Making my study space clear and getting ready to study.\n\n### 5. Coffee time.\n\nAfter having my table cleared and books ready for studying I make a coffee for myself. And then get down with my studies with a coffee mug in my hand.\n\n### 6.Study time\n\nGetting on to the most serious activity of my day and my life, i.e., studying.\n\nIn the morning I usually read topics that I think is difficult to comprehend. These include anatomy, pathology and pharmacology.\n\nRight from 6:30 to 10 AM I study with 30 minutes break in between.\n\nSo this was my morning routine. I know it may not be perfect according to many but routine for me must be productive and not perfect. As long as it is serving the purpose it's good. Make a timetable you are comfortable with and makes you happy and gets more work done.\n\nTHANK YOU❤️",

    title: 'My Year Without a Smartphone',
    body: "In 2016 my phone was taking over my life and I hated it. So, I sold my iPhone 6s and bought a BlackBerry Bold from 2007 with no touch screen and very little app compatibility. Originally, I thought getting a flip phone would be a good idea, but the thought of using a T9 keypad to send text messages scared me away. The BlackBerry made texting easy on its QWERTY keyboard while still restricting the overall functionality of my phone. At the time, it was the perfect compromise allowing me to stay connected without fuelling my phone addiction.\n\nAfter downgrading I instantly noticed big changes in my life. Listed below are the top three.\n### 1. No navigation\n\nThe scariest thing for me was not having access to Google maps. I am not great with directions and one day I found myself lost while exploring the Sydney CBD. Normally Google maps would bail me out, but that was no longer an option with my antiquated BlackBerry.\n\nAfter three years of living in Sydney, I never noticed the maps signposted along the streets offering helpful directions to pedestrians. Without a GPS to fall back on, I depended on my environment to show me where to go. I developed the habit of asking people for directions and making mental notes of various landmarks and street names. After a while, getting from place to place became second nature as I memorized my environment without depending on the blue line to reveal my path.\n\n### 2. No entertainment\n\nThe BlackBerry was remarkably boring. I didn’t have access to many apps and the user experience felt clunky compared to my old iPhone. When waiting at a bus stop or for my food at a cafe, I stopped getting the impulse to pull out my phone and stare at it. Instead, I spent more time thinking — staring into the void — processing life events and daydreaming about the future. Thinking is the most underrated activity of our time. Taking extended amounts of time to stop and think without Googling an answer to your question will change your life. You might realize, ‘Oh, I’m in the wrong career.’ Or, ‘I would like to start a new hobby as a shoe cobbler.’\n\nWith space to think, you might have a moment of clarity — surprising even yourself with the inkling that God is real and present in your life.\n\nToo often technology distracts us from healthy amounts of thinking and reflection. At least it did for me. And I endlessly benefitted from spending close to a year without the ability to distract myself with infinite amounts of entertainment in my pocket.\n\n### 3. No distractions\n\nHaving a smartphone causes your attention to be fragmented. You can never focus on one thing at a time because you are always switching between various trains of thought.\n\nNot carrying a smartphone helped me remain more present with people and important tasks. When I was out, if anyone wanted to contact me, they could text or call — that’s it. I didn’t get a notification every time someone posted on Instagram or Facebook. And the clunky nature of the BlackBerry Gmail app discouraged me from checking my emails. All the extras like email and social media were better handled at home on my laptop allowing me to be more intentional with my time.\nWould I do it again?\n\nIn 2022 I own more tech than ever. I have two computers, a smartphone, an iPad, and a smartwatch. And I use all of it every day. The exponential growth of technology in the last few years has deepened my dependence on devices more than ever. In 2016 owning a smartphone was helpful but mostly entertaining. Now, having a smartphone is essential. If nothing else, I need it for my job. But it still comes with all the drawbacks that made me despise my iPhone in 2016.\n\nAs of January this year, BlackBerry phones are no longer supported. So, putting my sim card in my old BlackBerry as an escape from my iPhone for a few months isn’t an option anymore. Regardless, I am feeling the itch to disconnect from my smartphone once again.\n\nWhat are my options in 2022?\n\n1. Deleting most of the apps on my phone. I tried this once with little success.\n    \n2. Switching to a dumb phone like the Nokia 225 4G. As long as I never have to send a text message, then sure!\n    \n3. The [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/). This ‘minimalist phone’ looks cool but I don't know if it is a quality product. It could be more of an overpriced gimmick than a practical tool.\n\nI may have to accept that the perfect smartphone replacement does not exist. But if it does, please let me know.",

      'What happened when the dinosaur-killing asteroid slammed into Earth?',
    body: "Hidden below the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the Chicxulub crater marks the impact site of an asteroid that struck Earth 66 million years ago. The most consequential outcome of this cataclysmic event was the [fifth mass extinction](https://www.livescience.com/mass-extinction-events-that-shaped-Earth.html), which wiped out about 80% of all animal species, including the nonavian [dinosaurs](https://www.livescience.com/3945-history-dinosaurs.html). \n\nBut what really happened when the asteroid collided with Earth? \n\nBy studying the geology both at Chicxulub and worldwide, scientists have pieced together what happened that terrible day and the years following it.\n\nEven before the asteroid hit, it was primed for decimation, colliding with Earth at the most destructive angle, according to a 2020 study published in [Nature Communications](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&xcust=livescience_us_2608503230870228500&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-15269-x%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dcommission_junction%26utm_campaign%3D3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100052172%26utm_content%3Ddeeplink&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fdinosaur-killing-asteroid-struck-earth) (opens in new tab). The asteroid was about 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) in diameter and was traveling about 27,000 mph (43,000 km/h) when it created a 124-mile-wide (200 km) scar on the planet's surface, said Sean Gulick, a research professor at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, who led the study. More importantly, the asteroid struck the planet at about 60 degrees above the horizon. This angle was particularly destructive because it allowed the asteroid's impact to eject a large amount of dust and aerosols into the atmosphere. \n\nGulick pointed to his colleague's [evidence](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&xcust=livescience_us_2704954649286292500&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-15269-x%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dcommission_junction%26utm_campaign%3D3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100052172%26utm_content%3Ddeeplink&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fdinosaur-killing-asteroid-struck-earth) (opens in new tab) in the region to support the simulations for the angled hit, including the asymmetrical structure of the crater, the position of upwarped (bent upward) mantle rocks, the unique sediment sequences in cores gathered from the region and, in particular, the absence of a distinct type of rock, called evaporites, in the cores, like halite and gypsum.\n\nGulick's team estimated that the impact would have vaporized the evaporite rocks, sending 325 gigatons of [sulfur](https://www.livescience.com/28939-sulfur.html) in the form of sulfur aerosols, as well as 435 gigatons of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.\n\nThe material thrown into the atmosphere consisted largely of pulverized rock and droplets of sulfuric acid, which came from sulfate-rich marine rocks, known as anhydrite, that vaporized during the asteroid strike, according to a 2014 study published in the journal [Nature Geoscience](https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2095). This cloud of microscopic material created a shroud around the planet, reducing incoming solar heat and light. The resulting long-term cooling drastically altered the planet's climate. A 2016 study in the journal [Geophysical Research Letters](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL072241) found that the average temperature in the tropics plummeted from 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) to 41 F (5 C). As incoming sunlight dimmed, [photosynthesis](https://www.livescience.com/51720-photosynthesis.html) waned and the base of the food chain on land and in the ocean collapsed, bringing down the dinosaurs and many other animals.\n\nMeanwhile, the airborne sulfuric acid led to [lethal acid rain](https://www.livescience.com/43960-asteroid-extinction-sulfur-ocean-acidification.html) that rained for days following the impact, killing countless marine animals living in the upper parts of oceans, as well as in lakes and rivers, the 2014 study found. \n\nThe impact also triggered massive tsunamis, shallow water waves that propagated through Earth's oceans. The wave initially reached nearly 1 mile (1.5 km) high and traveled 89 mph (143 km/h), and other waves reached massive heights, including up to 46 feet (15 m) in the Atlantic Ocean and 13 feet (4 m) in the North Pacific Ocean, [according to modeling research](https://www.livescience.com/64426-dinosaur-killing-asteroid-caused-giant-tsunami.html). What's more, depositional evidence from the massive waves is preserved in the sediment record around Louisiana. A 3D seismic survey of the geology under Louisiana revealed long, asymmetrical 52-feet-tall (16 m) [mega ripples](https://www.livescience.com/megaripples-tsunami-dinosaur-asteroid.html) that point back to the impact site in the Gulf.\n\n## And fires raged\n\n![Antarctica_Dinosaurs.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/da5df418-afa6-4761-94d0-71ab68da2d69)\n\nThe pulverized rock and ash cascading back to the surface after the impact also [ignited a series of wildfires](https://www.livescience.com/28582-asteroid-extinction-firestorm.html) that researchers likened to a broiler igniting dry tinder. The additional smoke and ash likely contributed to the cooling shroud, further reducing incoming sunlight.\n\nIt's easy for geologists to see when the asteroid hit when they examine rock layers; in rocks around the world dating to the end of the [Cretaceous period](https://www.livescience.com/29231-cretaceous-period.html) 66 million years ago, there's a thin layer of clay enriched with [iridium](https://www.livescience.com/39143-iridium.html), an element rare on Earth but common among space rocks, a landmark 1980 study published in the journal [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.208.4448.1095) found. But while other spectacular events, including wildfires and tsunamis, capture the imagination, Gulick believes the bigger deal was changes in Earth's atmosphere, where the ghastly shroud led to cooling that lasted for more than a decade. \n\n\"The only way to make a mass extinction event is to mess with something that affects the entire planet,\" he said. \"Here you have direct evidence of that happening.\"",

    title:
      'Jurassic Park 1.0: Chicken With Dinosaur Features Has Been Created by Scientists',
    body: 'In a groundbreaking experiment, scientists have transformed chicken embryos to give them a snout and palate configuration similar to that of small dinosaurs like Velociraptor and Archaeopteryx.\n\nThe team did not set out to create a “dino-chicken” per se, said the lead authors of a study published in the journal [Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.12684). Bhart-Anjan Bhullar of Yale University in New Haven and Arkhat Abzhanov of Harvard University in Cambridge, US, originally wanted to understand how the bird beak, a very vital part of bird anatomy that has been crucial for their success, evolved.\n\n“Whenever you examine an important evolutionary transformation, you want to learn the underlying mechanism,” Bhullar added.\n\nFinding a mechanism to recreate elements of dinosaur physiology has been a topic of popular interest ever since the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs emerged in the 19th century, when scientists discovered the fossil of an early bird-like animal called Archaeopteryx. Similar to other fossils more recently discovered, the animal had wings and feathers, but it also looked a lot like a dinosaur.\n\n![scientist-accidentally-hatches-dino-2.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/adbc7694-4651-4113-ac4e-4143b0ccaf49)\n\nHowever, these early birds didn’t look the same as modern ones. In particular, instead of beaks they had snouts, like those of their dinosaur ancestors. To understand how one changed into another, Bhullar’s team has been tampering with the molecular processes that make up a beak in chickens.\n\n“I wanted to know what the beak was skeletally, functionally and when this major transformation occurred from a normal vertebrate snout to the very unique structures used in birds,” Bhullar said.\n\nWhile trying to do just that, the team managed to create a chicken embryo with a dinosaur-like snout and palate, similar to that of small feathered dinosaurs like Velociraptors.\n\n![scientist-accidentally-hatches-dino-5.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/3d9e547d-f8ee-4209-bdb6-308e51869de4)\n\nThe team started out by trawling though changes in the ways genes are expressed in the embryos of chickens and several other animals including mice, alligators, emus, turtles and lizards. Such a thorough investigaton of some of the major animal groups revealed that birds have a unique cluster of genes related to facial development that are lacking in non-beaked creatures.\n\nWhen the scientists silenced these genes, the beak structure reverted back to its ancestral state, and so too did the palatal bone in the roof of the mouth, as demonstrated by this image.\n\n![scientist-accidentally-hatches-dino-6.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/3512f0b9-19cc-462b-a2fe-2dc84b42c335)\n\nTo achieve this genetic tweak, the team isolated the proteins that would have gone on to develop beaks. Then, using tiny beads coated with an inhibiting substance, they suppressed those proteins. When the skeletons started to develop inside the eggs, the animals had short, rounded bones instead of elongated, fused beaks found in bird skeletons\n\nAlthough Bhullar has no plans, or ethical approval, to hatch the snouted chickens, he believes they would have been able to survive “just fine”.\n\n“These weren’t drastic modifications,” Bhullar explained. “They are far less weird than many breeds of chicken developed by chicken hobbyists and breeders. The rest of the animal looked OK, but one needs to think about this carefully from an ethical point of view.”\n\n![scientist-accidentally-hatches-dino-7-1068x534.jpeg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/3b1beafb-66ac-486c-a883-10d3320405ab)\n\nIn another similar experiment, researcher Joao Botelho at the University of Chile has successfully managed to genetically recreate an elongated fibula in a bird embryo. Botelho used a bird fibula, a thin bone that runs down the length of the lower leg. In modern birds, this bone does not extend down to the ankle, but in their dinosaur ancestors it definitely did.\n\nBotelho’s team also found that modern bird embryos actually start out with this ancestral trait. Over time, however, the fibula shortens greatly and the adult bird has a tiny, fragment-like fibula instead of a long, hollow one. With that information at hand, all the researchers had to do was inhibit the gene that allowed for this kind of bone growth at an embryonic level.\n\nAgain, the researchers’ aim was not to bring dinosaurs back to life. Instead, they wanted to understand bird evolution on the molecular level like never done before.\n\n![scientist-accidentally-hatches-dino-3-1068x611.jpg](https://d3sjlfriau3aek.cloudfront.net/e62978b6-728b-404e-8db5-aba65853cf34)\n\nAnother person experienting with so-called chickensaurs is Jack Horner, curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies and a professor at Montana State University. The scientific consultant for Jurassic Park, he is also the visionary behind creating a genetically altered domestic fowl with the teeth, claws and long tail of a small carnivorous dinosaur. His team has been working on lengthening the tail of the chicken at an embryonic level, based on the fact that all animal embryos have more bones in their tail when in the womb or egg.\n\nHorner is determined to create a dinosaur-chicken mix, which, according to him, will just be a genetically modified chicken. He also admits that creating an elongated tail in a bird embryo may not be too difficult but whether the adult bird will be able to use it is another question. Predatory non-avian dinosaurs also had dextrous fingers for grasping prey, so an adult bird might need a lot of muscular and nervous re-tweaking in order to be able to use these new features.\n\n![chickensaurIs this what the future of genetic engineering will look like?](https://earthlymission.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/scientist-accidentally-hatches-dino-8.jpg)\n\nSo, while a number of scientists have been working in parallel to reveal the secrets of avian evolution, there are still questions to be answered. But you definitely should stay tuned for the next big development in genetics.\n\nBhullar himself believes that in 15 or 20 years we’ll have all the necessary tools and information to hatch a living, breathing, dino-chicken that runs around snatching up prey in its toothy snout like a little velociraptor.\n\n“This isn’t theoretical,” he underlines. “I’m not talking half a century here; I’m talking decades. It’s going to happen.”',
